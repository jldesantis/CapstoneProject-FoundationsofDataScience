Capstone Project Ideas
1.	Predictive Maintenance – Can we predict equipment breakdown using both vibration analysis and downtime event data?
a.	Problem: Unscheduled maintenance events cause costly delays and preventive maintenance is often performed before it is necessary.
b.	Benefit: Avoid the cost of unscheduled breakdowns and unnecessary maintenance tasks by allocating resources only to the equipment that requires attention.
c.	Data: I currently have access to downtime event data and can collect vibration data using the VibSensor app for iPhone.

2.	Accident Prevention – Can we determine when an on-the-job injury is more likely to occur? Are employees more likely to engage in unsafe behavior before or after a holiday, on certain days of the week, or under certain temperature conditions?
a.	Problem: In addition to physical harm, workplace injuries can result in a loss of income for workers and a loss of productivity for manufacturers. Efforts to increase safety awareness often become repetitive and do not hold the attention of the workforce.
b.	Benefit: Achieve the maximum benefit from safety awareness events by targeting high risk days instead of following an arbitrary schedule. 
c.	Data: OSHA injury records https://www.osha.gov/severeinjury/index.html, weather records https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd/data-access, and calendar data. 

3.	Supplier Quality Analysis – Can we determine which components run most efficiently on a production line?
a.	Problem: Often components from outside suppliers pass initial quality inspection despite minute variance in size, shape, or weight. Equipment performs better with consistency and these small variances can cause unforeseen delays.
b.	Benefit: Determining which components run most efficiently will allow purchasers to focus on these items.
c.	Data: I currently have access to production downtime data as well as bills of materials.
